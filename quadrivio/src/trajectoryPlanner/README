THIS NODE IS IN TESTING PHASE, SO IT COULD WORK NOT PROPERLY

This folder contains the ros node to make plans with sbpl. To use this node is important make some preliminary steps:

- First of all install sbpl on the system
	- Clone the svn repo at address https://svn.ws.dei.polimi.it/airlab/Thesis/ConfortoAndrea-779840/sbpl/
	- Execute some commands into sbpl directory
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make
		sudo make install
	- Now sbpl is installed into your system

- Open the file planConf.yaml and substitute <SBPL_REPOCLONED_ROOT> with the directory cloned previously or specify a valid motion primitives file
- Copy the piece of configuration into a used configuration file or load planConf.yaml configuration file during launch
- Adding the subdirectory in the CMakeLists.txt file of the quadrivio node
- Compile the ROS node
- The planner should work

How to use:

- Launch the node with
	rosrun quadrivio trajectoryPlanner
  or include the node into a launch file
- The map is given via topic /map. However, map_server actually provides only 1s & 0s maps.
  To have a better map for planning clone the ROS node at the link
	https://svn.ws.dei.polimi.it/airlab/Thesis/ConfortoAndrea-779840/map_server_decimal_costs
  compile it, place the terminal in a directory with a png greyscale file and its corresponding yaml file  and launch node with
	rosrun map_server_decimal_costs map_server_decimal_costs <FILE_NAME>.yaml
- The start position actually is given statically by code, after will be given by roamfree (roamfree must be in execution anyway)
- The goal position is given to the planner using rviz, so launch rviz with
	rosrun rviz rviz
  and open testPlanner.rviz; a map should be visualized. Now select 2D Nav Goal and click on the map where you want the goal
- The planning process should start
